# Scope of work
My central question is: how do we know what we know?
That's the guiding question of epistemology as well, but my hunch is that approaching the question through Psychology (*how do each of us personally come to know what we know?*) and through Philosophy of Science (*how do communities come to know what they know?*) end up being more fruitful ways to address the question. 
That's why my projects roughly break into those two areas:

## Psychology

### Attitudes towards Science

## Philosophy of Science
